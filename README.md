# Weather Forecasting with PySpark

Using Machine Learning and Big Data technologies, I am tackling **weather forecasting** in this project to demonstrate if it is feasible to provide useful forecasts of weather conditions just from previously observed meteorological data.  Therefore, the classification purpose is to forecast which meteorological condition should occur given a collection of weather observations.


## Dataset

The dataset comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/selfishgene/historical-hourly-weather-data)
and contains hourly weather measurements data of **36** cities, collected from
2012 to 2017. This 5 years of data result in approximately **45.000** measurements
(for each city) of temperature, humidity, air pressure and the like.
